# vrp-genetic-algorithm
Genetic algorithm implementation to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), aiming to minimize the total distance traveled from a central depot. It uses classic evolutionary operators such as tournament selection, balanced crossover, move mutation, and 2-opt local optimization. Includes result visualization and performance analysis.
